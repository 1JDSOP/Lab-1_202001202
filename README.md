* As written in paragraph around 5% of the world populaton is suffering from desabling hearing loss, this application help them using Artificial intelligence.
* AI can detect sounds and like vehicals horns, crying sound, etc. Using this feature mobile app will alert the user.

### **Features:**
* Common Sound detection using AI.
* Alert the user when detect critical sounds.
* High prediction ability AI.
* Low power consuming and very low response time.
* Always running in Background.
* Notify friends and family in case when no response from the user when a critical situation is detected.

### **Non-Functional Aspects:**
